<h1>Hello!</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Congrats, PHPSkeleton is up and running.</h3>

<p>The controller for this page is at</p>

<code class="path">app/controllers/greeting-controller.php</code>

<p>The wrapper (doctype, head, etc) is at</p>

<code class="path">app/views/wrapper.php</code>

<p>and this text is at</p>

<code class="path">app/views/html/greeting/helloworld.php</code>

<p>Given the current routing setup (at <code>app/routes.php</code>), you could also view this exact same page at <a href="index.php/greeting/helloworld">greeting/helloworld</a>.</p>

<p>To get started, delete those and start writing your own models, views, and controllers. Also pop over to <code>app/config.php</code> to tell the system where your database is, and <code>app/routes.php</code> to change the default controller from &#8216;greeting&#8217; to something more suitable.</p>

<p>More documentation is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phpskeleton/">here</a>.</p>
